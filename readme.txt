I'm an RTS fan, but I don't have time for a fully-fledged project. Ever once and 
a while I get develop a little piece of technology though, and here I've put a
few of these together to form a demo, including:

- scrolling
- zooming to cursor
- A* search algorithm

For free to refer to this and/or fork it nessecary. Do let me know though: It's
always nice to know you're code's being put to some use ;)

Otherwise I'll try to add to this code-base sporadically, as and when I have
 time.
